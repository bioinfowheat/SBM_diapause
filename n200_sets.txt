From Lea

attaching to this email 2 folders with gene expression data from 2 methods (DESeq2 or the VOOM method from the article). 
Each folder is for a body part (he=head & ab=abdomen) and has:
three subsets of 200 genes per method named 1, 2 and 3 

The full data table for each method
(the *_voom files being for the voom method and the others for the DESeq2) 

Here are the pipelines for each method:
With DESeq2:
Raw counts table:
    Filter lowly expressed genes:
        CPM threshold > 1
        In at least 2 samples for each gene
    Run DESeq () on the count table:
        Normalize through DESeq2 (correcting for differences in library sizes or sequencing depths by correcting with size factor)
    3 random subsets of 200 genes from final table

###
With TMM + VOOM + limma:

Raw counts table:
    Filter lowly expressed genes:
        CPM threshold > 1
        In at least 2 samples for each gene
    TMM normalize the data for composition bias: adjust for differences in library sizes and composition biases between samples
    VOOM transform the data:
        applies log-counts per million (logCPM) transformation, to account for differences in library size across samples
        estimates the mean-variance trend in the data, to help ensure that genes with different expression levels are weighted appropriately in the statistical model
    Maybe possible to remove batch effect from covariate as they did but which covariate…? (So not done now…)
    3 random subsets of 200 genes from final table
